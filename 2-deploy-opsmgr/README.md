The MongoDB Kubernetes Operator requires MongoDB Ops Manager, which can itself be deployed via Kubernetes or can be stood up separately. If deploying externally, Kubernetes only needs the connect info. The command to create the secret is provided here, the connect info is provided subsequently in a ConfigMap when you deploy a MongoDB resource. This repo does not contain any other resources to deploy Ops Manager externally (these resources exist elsewhere). For the most part, this repo assumes you will be deploying Ops Manager via Kubernetes. If you do have access to a running Ops Manager, it can be very helpful for testing, as only a small subset of the containers are used.
